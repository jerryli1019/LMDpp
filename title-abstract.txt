Title:
SON: Enhancing Prompt Understanding of Diffusion Models with Large Language Models Guided Layouts

Abstract:
The recent development of text-to-image (T2I) models has unlocked numer-
ous possibilities for content creation, particularly by offering inspiration to
designers. However, current approaches often face challenges in accurately
following prompts to generate images. These challenges include arranging
non-overlapping objects in various spatial relationships and producing the
correct number of desired objects, both of which are crucial for many de-
sign tasks. We introduce Spatial-Overlap-Numeracy-1K (SON-1K), a com-
prehensive benchmark for text-to-image generation. This benchmark com-
prises 1,000 complex prompts spanning three subtasks: spatial relationships,
numeracy counts, and complex natural prompts. Alongside the benchmark,
we propose several evaluation metrics to assess compliance with the prompts
comprehensively. We also propose a new approach, the Language Model-
Guided Diffusion++ (LMDpp), enhancing the performance of the novel two-
stage Large Language Model (LLM)-grounded diffusion model pipeline (LMD).
We report experimental results of previous major T2I models and our en-
hanced LMDpp, along with its baseline on SON-1K, and provide an analysis
of our new metrics.
